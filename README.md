# GL4SS3S Core ðŸ‘“

GL4SS3S is the Arduino code part of the global GL4SS3S project.

The project is an electronic glasses device that allow to show data trough a reflection of a screen on mirror and plastic based on the original [Alain Project Data Glasses](https://alainsprojects.com/2016/10/07/featured-on-hackaday-com/)

On Top of that I added some button ( and lot of code ) on the device to allow the user to navigate trough a menu and select wich data he want to see

The device is paired trough [BLE](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_%C3%A0_basse_consommation) with an android application that fetch or store data for it
